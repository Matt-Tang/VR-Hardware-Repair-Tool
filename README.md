# VR-Hardware-Repair-Tool

This was built and developed in Unity 3D.

This was a VR repair tool that was created in 48 Hours. Using Virtual Reality (VR) to train people on how to repair our timeclocks 
seems like a bit of a joke, but it's actually a tool that could really help the company. Learning in a risk-free environment
where you're free to experiment can not only speed up the learning process, save time and money, and also be significantly 
more entertaining.
